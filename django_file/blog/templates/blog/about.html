<h1>About</h1>
<hr />
<br />

<p style="font-size: large;">This is my first Django project. I always wanted to make a gaming blog with latest gaming news and stuff, so that is why I chose my first Django project to be a Gaming Blog.</p>
<br/>
<p style="font-size: large;">I mostly learned Django from documentation, stackoverflow and some great Youtubers such as Corey Schafer, Dennis Ivy and Codemy.com</p>
